# Hardware Requirements

This course involves hands-on development with Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, which requires specific hardware for optimal performance.

## Workstation Requirements

A powerful workstation is essential for running simulations, training AI models, and developing complex robotics software.

| Component      | Recommendation                                      | Minimum Specification         |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **GPU**        | NVIDIA RTX 3080 or better (12GB+ VRAM)            | NVIDIA RTX 3060 (8GB VRAM)    |
| **CPU**        | Intel Core i7 (10th Gen+) / AMD Ryzen 7 (3000 series+) | Intel Core i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 |
| **RAM**        | 32 GB DDR4                                          | 16 GB DDR4                    |
| **Storage**    | 1 TB NVMe SSD                                       | 500 GB SSD                    |
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 20.04+ (Recommended for ROS 2 and NVIDIA SDKs) | Windows 10/11 (with WSL2)     |

## Edge Computing Kit

For deploying AI models directly onto a robot or embedded system, an edge computing device is required.

| Device          | Recommendation                          | Notes                                       |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **NVIDIA Jetson** | Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit (8GB/16GB) | Ideal for AI inference on the edge          |

## Robot Options

You will have the option to work with different humanoid robots, each offering unique capabilities.

| Robot Model     | Key Features                                       | Cost (Approx.) |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Unitree Go2** | Advanced quadruped robot, highly stable, good for locomotion studies | \$3,000 - \$5,000 |
| **Unitree G1**  | Miniature humanoid, agile, good for manipulation tasks   | \$8,000 - \$10,000 |
| **Open-source/DIY** | Flexible, customizable, requires significant effort and expertise | Variable        |

## Cost Breakdown (Estimated)

Here’s an estimated cost breakdown for setting up your development environment and acquiring necessary hardware. Prices are approximate and can vary.

| Item                 | Estimated Cost   |
| :------------------- | :--------------- |
| **Workstation Upgrade** | \$500 - \$2,000   |
| **Jetson Orin Nano** | \$199 - \$499    |
| **Robot (Optional)** | \$3,000 - \$10,000 |
| **Sensors & Peripherals** | \$200 - \$500    |
| **Total (excluding robot)** | \$899 - \$2,999  |
| **Total (with robot)** | \$3,899 - \$12,999 |
